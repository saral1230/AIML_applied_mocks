# Data-Driven Solutions for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing & Supply Chain Challenges

This document outlines two demonstration projects showcasing the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data science to address critical priorities within the pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply chain sectors. These projects illustrate how data-driven approaches can enhance resilience, quality, efficiency, and adaptability in this highly regulated industry.

## Projects Overview

* [**Predictive Maintenance Mock Project:**](https://github.com/saral1230/AIML_applied_mocks/tree/main/predictive_maintenance_mock) Demonstrates how machine learning can predict equipment failures to minimize downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.
* **Root Cause Analysis Mock Project:** Illustrates how data science techniques can be used to identify the underlying causes of batch quality failures.

## The Challenges in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing & Supply Chains

The pharmaceutical industry faces significant complexities in its manufacturing and supply chains, demanding innovative solutions to ensure:

* **Resilient & Secure Supply:** Preventing drug shortages, mitigating disruptions, and combating counterfeit drugs.
* **Stringent Quality & Compliance:** Maintaining end-to-end traceability, cold chain integrity, and adherence to global regulations.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Optimizing production processes, reducing waste, and strategically addressing talent gaps.
* **Adaptability & Innovation:** Effectively supporting personalized medicines, facilitating digital transformation, and advancing sustainability initiatives.

Addressing these multifaceted challenges necessitates proactive, data-driven strategies to minimize risks, enhance operational efficiency, and ultimately safeguard patient well-being.

## Predictive Maintenance Mock Project

This project showcases a streamlined predictive maintenance solution for industrial equipment, a critical aspect of ensuring continuous pharmaceutical production. By simulating a real-world scenario, the project utilizes machine learning models to analyze synthetic sensor data (including vibration, temperature, and pressure metrics) to forecast potential equipment failures.

**Key Features:**

* Analyzes synthetic sensor data to predict equipment failures.
* Incorporates an A/B testing framework to compare predictive vs. traditional maintenance.
* Deploys the core predictive model as a real-time API for operational integration.
* Includes a complementary anomaly detection module for identifying rare failure events.

This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates the practical application of predictive analytics to optimize maintenance operations, minimizing downtime and improving efficiency.

## Root Cause Analysis Mock Project

The project tackles a fundamental challenge in pharmaceutical manufacturing: identifying the underlying reasons for batch quality failures, a critical aspect of maintaining product safety and regulatory compliance. To simulate this real-world problem, the project integrates interconnected datasets—encompassing batch records, process parameters, QC/QA results, and supply chain logs—into a comprehensive analytical pipeline.

**Key Steps:**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** To uncover underlying patterns and anomalies within the integrated datasets.
* **Machine Learning (Random Forest):** To rank the factors most likely contributing to batch quality failures.
* **Time Series Analysis:** To trace the origins of issues through temporal trends in the data.

This structured methodology effectively bridges data science techniques with critical operational insights, mirroring how pharmaceutical manufacturers diagnose and implement solutions to mitigate quality risks and prevent future failures.
